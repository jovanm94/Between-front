    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <h4>COUNTERPARTY RELATIONSHIP
      </h4>
      <p>Business entities often encounter counterparty trust issues, leading to costly and timely confirmation process on open item lists. Lack of standardization and interoperability gives rise to disconnected systems.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <h4>COUNTERPARTY RELATIONSHIP
      </h4>
      <p>Between platform offers invoice verification protocol through registration of invoice information on an immutable distributed ledger through permission based mechanism.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <h4>INVOICE FINANCING
      </h4>
      <p>Mitigation of cash flow fluctuations through invoice financing is reliant on manual work and followed by complex procedures to reduce risk for financiers, leading to expensive financing solutions. In current state, no direct relationship is established between invoice issuer, invoice financier and invoice payer. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <h4>INVOICE FINANCING
      </h4>
      <p>Platform users can interact directly through the platform with counterparties and financiers, who can grant invoice financing (direct factoring or/and reverse factoring) based on verified financial data, screening creditworthiness of both parties to the transaction.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <h4>FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
      </h4>
      <p>The financier is dependent on the information provided by invoice issuer. One of the main obstacles for business entities seeking invoice financing is to prove positive financial history. The same is not possible for a vast majority of small and medium enterprises.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <h4>FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
      </h4>
      <p>Users have direct access to fully automated financial analytics based on near to real-time data instead of outdated information, through which they can understand and measure business results and targets.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12 centerText">
      <h4>CORE PLATFORM ADVANTAGES
      </h4>
      <p>Between platform leverages a core feature of the blockchain called immutability. When an invoice information is stored on the blockchain, it can never be changed. Seamless eco-system with permissioned access and verification protocol brings trust and transparency to all parties involved. Dynamic invoices introduce ease invoice information update reducing paperwork, while preserving sensitive information.</p>
